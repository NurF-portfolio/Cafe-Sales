# Cafe-sales-data-analysis

## Overview

This project focuses on cleaning and analyzing dirty café sales data sourced from a dataset on Kaggle. The data was processed using Microsoft Excel for data cleaning and subsequently visualized using Power BI. The main objective of this project is to ensure data quality and to present meaningful insights through effective data visualization.

## Data sourced

The Dirty Cafe Sales dataset contains 10,000 rows of synthetic data representing sales transactions in a café. This dataset is intentionally designed to be “dirty,” containing missing values, inconsistent entries, and errors to simulate real-world data quality issues. It is suitable for practicing data cleaning techniques, data wrangling, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).

## Tool Used

- **Microsoft Excel** – Used for initial data exploration and data cleaning.  
- **Excel VBA** – Used to automate data cleaning tasks, handle missing values, and perform data sorting and restructuring.  
- **Power BI** – Used to create interactive dashboards for sales analysis and error analysis, enabling clear visualization of trends, patterns, and data quality issues.
